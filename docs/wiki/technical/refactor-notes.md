# Refactor notes

This project used to be one 2,900-line `lanternmoss.html`. It was split into the modules above. A side-by-side
"golden master" comparison checked that gameplay and visuals are unchanged: both versions ran the same 71-checkpoint
scripted session with seeded randomness, ending in identical state, and rendered pixel-identical frames.

Changes made on the way:

- **Must be served over HTTP** now (ES module files), hence `npm start`.
- **Respawn sun direction:** after fainting, the sun was reset to a different bearing than at startup or restart.
  Respawn now uses the same reset (`World.resetSun()`).
- **Hidden coupling removed:** the wolf companion relied on writing a scratch vector shared with every critter's head
  animation, so each critter now owns its `toP`. Villager gestures were chosen by comparing NPC names, so they are
  now a `gesture` field in the villager data. The audio toggle no longer shows the toast itself. The challenge
  runtime no longer moves HUD elements. Buff timers no longer tick inside the HUD drawing code.
- **No more monkey-patching:** knight sounds and knight abilities used to be bolted onto `AudioSys` / `CAST` with
  `Object.assign` from a later section. Each now has one definition.
- **Duplication and dead code:** camera shake (11 copies), camera snap, collider removal and spawn placement each
  have one helper now. Duplicated CSS rules are merged. An unused CSS variable, an unused `houseB` constant and a
  hand-maintained list of model part names are gone. Both heroes' skill hints now live in config (the witch's used
  to be hard-coded in the HTML).
- **Tests** import the real modules directly. The XP math takes its config as an optional argument, so tests can use
  a hand-checkable curve.
